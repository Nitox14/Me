Who am I?

About Me: 
As a passionate and detail-oriented Cybersecurity Analyst, I thrive in safeguarding organizations against evolving digital threats. With a strong foundation built through a Post Graduate Diploma in Cybersecurity and hands-on experience as a SOC Analyst, I am adept at monitoring, analyzing, and mitigating security incidents in critical environments.

I specialize in incident response, log analysis, and threat detection using advanced SIEM tools like Splunk and QRadar. My expertise extends to penetration testing, vulnerability management, and digital forensics, backed by real-world projects such as monitoring suspicious login attempts and detecting malicious processes. These projects, combined with my eJPT certification, have honed my skills in identifying vulnerabilities and crafting proactive security measures.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities to contribute as a Blue Team Analyst or entry-level cybersecurity professional where I can leverage my technical expertise and analytical mindset to strengthen organizational defenses.

I am open to connecting with cybersecurity professionals and recruiters, as well as engaging in discussions about the latest trends and challenges in the cybersecurity landscape. Letâ€™s connect and secure the digital world together!
